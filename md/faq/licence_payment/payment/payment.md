### Will I have to pay for it in the future?

All the major features of cables will always be free for use by everyone. There is no plans on restricting use to
any current or new ops or features to something like "pro" or "premium" users.

If things get too big we might charge for additional storage space for your assets or something. Rest assured
that the free version will be abolutely usable at all times.

### If so what kind of payment models will there be?

As said, there will be none.
