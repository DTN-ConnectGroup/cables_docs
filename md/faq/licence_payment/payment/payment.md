### Will I have to pay for it in the future?

All the major features of cables will always be free for use by everyone. There is no plans on restricting use to
any current or new ops or features to something like "pro" or "premium" users.

If things get too big we might charge for additional storage space for your assets or something. Rest assured
that the free version will be abolutely usable at all times.

### If so what kind of payment models will there be?

As said, there will be none.

### Is there a way to support cables development somehow?

First of all: spread the word. Use it! Give feedback. If you want to financially support us, currently your
best option would be to contact us and maybe pay for the development of a feature. We have a very long list
of stuff that WE want to do, but maybe you need something specific for your project or would like to "buy"
a better place on our TODO-List for anything up our sleeves? Simply contact us!
